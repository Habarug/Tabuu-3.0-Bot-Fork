## Running the bot

Since this bot is only intended to be used on the SSBU Training Grounds Server, this means that **you cannot just invite a running instance of the bot to your own server.**  
What you can do instead is run your own instance of this bot. Please keep in mind however that this bot is being developed with only the SSBU Training Grounds Server and affiliated Servers in mind, as a result this is likely to not be ideal for your own Discord Server.

With all that being said, head over to the [RUNNING.md](/RUNNING.md) file for a detailed guide on how to set up this bot in your own environment.
